            <p>
              El Cielo Cozumel, known as "HEAVEN", is one of Cozumel's best kept
              secrets. It is the most magnificent place in the Caribbean Sea.
              Cozumel's El Cielo is only accessible by boat and is about a mile
              from Cozumel's Shoreline, and a 25 minute boat ride from the
              nearest cruise pier. El Cielo has shallow crystal clear water as
              far as the eye can see, which makes it it a perfect place to relax
              and enjoy the Caribbean Sea. El Cielo Cozumel is covered with soft
              powdered white sand that massage your feet every step you take.
              There are lots of starfish located in El Cielo and you'll as find
              stingrays gliding by only yards from you, also enjoying El Cielo
              (Stingrays are harmless).

              Laguna de Colombia, part of a three-lagoon system that is the
              habitat of crocodiles. Crocs can be seen from either the shore,
              from a trail through mangroves or from the dock over the lagoon.
              You may climb some stairs to a nice lookout over the lagoon, and
              there is also a trail through mangroves. There is a boat ride that
              takes people to discover the lagoon a couple times a day. You may
              see many resident and migratory waterfowl and many other rare &
              unique creatures during your exciting exploration of Punta Sur
              Cozumel. Its a real treat to see the different animals at the
              ecological reserve at Punta Sur. You can see anything from island
              Raccoons (much smaller and friendlier than normal Raccoons and its
              also a rare type of Raccoon only found in Cozumel) and even
              flamingos.
